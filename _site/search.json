I previously worked as a Supply Chain Officer in Thailand for three years, where I managed inventory, improved warehouse efficiency, and support procurement with suppliers. Currently, I am developing mu skills in communicating data efficiently, through blog building. My first blog post explores the burden of Healthcare-associated infections in Germany. I am an enthusiastic leaner with passion to pursue new challenges in life. I enjoy collaborating in teams with great vibes and bring a foundation in programming to support problem-solving and data analysis."

    "text": "Everybody goes to hospital to receive a cure. What if you went there for treatment but ended up with another infection. This is not a rare occurrence since 1 of every 25 patients in Germany were affected. These healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are a silent crisis that strikes tens of thousands of people every year. In 2011, HAIs resulted in approximately 487,000 cases and claimed over 16,000 lives (Zacher, 2019). To be exact, the burden of HAIs causes more death than from influenza, Salmonella, Hepatitis B, and Measles combined. Despite Germany’s superb hospitals, the highest number of hospital beds and hospitalization rates exposed Germany to risk.\nWhat’s even more shocking? Research found that many of these infections can be prevented with basic changes in hygiene and hospital procedures.\nUnderstanding where these infections occur and which types are most dangerous is crucial for developing effective prevention strategies."
