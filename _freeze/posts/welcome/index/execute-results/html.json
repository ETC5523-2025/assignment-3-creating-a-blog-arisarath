What if you went there for treatment but ended up with another infection.* This is not a rare occurrence since **1 of every 25 patients** in Germany were affected. These healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are a silent crisis that strikes tens of thousands of people every year. In 2011, HAIs resulted in approximately **487,000 cases and claimed over 16,000 lives** (Zacher, 2019). To be exactly, the burden of HAIs causes more death than from influenza, Salmonella, Hepatitis B, and Measles combined. Despite Germany’s superb hospitals, the highest number of hospital beds and hospitalization rates exposed Germany to risk. \n\n*What’s even more shocking?* Research found that many of these infections can be prevented with basic changes in hygiene and hospital procedures.\n\nUnderstanding where these infections occur and which types are most dangerous is crucial for developing effective prevention strategies.\n\n## The Data\n### Where the data come from?\nThis analysis uses data from **2011 European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) Point Prevalence Survey** with BHAI method\n\nWe examined two datasets for Germany:\n\n-\t**Representative sample**: 46 hospitals with 9,626 patients\n-\t**Convenience sample**: 132 hospitals with 41,539 patients\n\n### What was tracked?\nBIG 5 types of HAIs\n\n- Clostridioides difficile (CDI)\n-\tHospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)\n-\tBloodstream infections (BSI)\n-\tUrinary tract infections (UTI)\n-\tSurgical site infections (SSI)\n\n### What was measured?\n-\tTotal number of cases\n-\tDeaths linked to infection\n-\tYears lost to disability or life (YLDs, YLLs, and summed up as DALYs)\n\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\n# Create data for the bubble chart\nhai_data <- data.frame(\n  infection_type = c(\"BSI\", \"HAP\", \"UTI\", \"SSI\", \"CDI\"),\n  num_hais = c(26976, 106586, 214150, 93222, 36002),\n  num_deaths = c(3905, 3968, 3664, 2328, 1917),\n  bubble_size = c(3000, 4500, 3500, 1500, 800)\n)\n\n# Create the bubble chart using ggplot2\nggplot(hai_data, aes(x = num_hais, y = num_deaths, size = bubble_size)) +\n  geom_point(color = \"#5B9BAD\", fill = \"#A8D5E2\", \n             shape = 21, stroke = 1.5, alpha = 0.5) +\n  geom_text(aes(label = infection_type), \n            color = \"#2F5F6F\", fontface = \"bold\", size = 5) +\n  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 250000)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 5000)) +\n  scale_size_continuous(range = c(10, 30)) +\n  labs(x = \"Number of HAIs\",\n       y = \"Number of attributable deaths\") +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"none\",\n        axis.text = element_text(size = 11),\n        axis.title = element_text(size = 12))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n![](thumbnail.jpg)\n\n\n",
