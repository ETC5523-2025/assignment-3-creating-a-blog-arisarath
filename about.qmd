# Arisara Therdthianwong
I am a Masterâ€™s student in Business, specializing Data analytics at Monash University. 
I previously worked as a Supply Chain Officer in Thailand for three years, where I managed inventory, improved warehouse efficiency, and support procurement with suppliers.
Currently, I am developing mu skills in communicating data efficiently, through blog building. My first blog post explores the burden of Healthcare-associated infections in Germany.
I am an enthusiastic leaner with passion to pursue new challenges in life. I enjoy collaborating in teams with great vibes and bring a foundation in programming to support problem-solving and data analysis.
