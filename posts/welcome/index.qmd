## The Problem: When Hospitals Become Sources of Infection
*Everybody goes to hospital to receive a cure. What if you went there for treatment but ended up with another infection.* This is not a rare occurrence since **1 of every 25 patients** in Germany were affected. These healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are a silent crisis that strikes tens of thousands of people every year. In 2011, HAIs resulted in approximately **487,000 cases and claimed over 16,000 lives** (Zacher, 2019). To be exact, the burden of HAIs causes more death than from influenza, Salmonella, Hepatitis B, and Measles combined. Despite Germany’s superb hospitals, the highest number of hospital beds and hospitalization rates exposed Germany to risk. 

*What’s even more shocking?* Research found that many of these infections can be prevented with basic changes in hygiene and hospital procedures.

Understanding where these infections occur and which types are most dangerous is crucial for developing effective prevention strategies.

## The Data
### Where the data come from?
This analysis uses data from **2011 European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) Point Prevalence Survey**. The original study by Zacher et al. (2019) applied *Burden of Healthcare-Associated Infections (BHAI)* method to calculate national HAI burden.

We used **Representative sample**: 46 hospitals with 9,626 patients across Germany.

### What was tracked?

5 major types of HAIs:

-	Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP)
-	Surgical site infections (SSI)
-	Bloodstream infections (BSI)
-	Urinary tract infections (UTI)
- Clostridioides difficile (CDI)

### What was measured?
-	Total number of cases
-	Deaths linked to infection
-	Disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), combining years lost to disability (YLDs) and years lost to life (YLLs)

### How we prepared the data

For this blog post, I work with **published point estimates** from Zacher et al. (2019).

Data preparations:

1. Selecting key variables: From full BHAI dataset, we selected cases, deaths, and DALYs of five major HAI types.

2. Sorting data: Ordering data in descending based on case frequency to highlight the most common infections with total number at the bottom.

3. Tidy data: Structured the published estimates into suitable visualisation.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: false

# Load packages
library(gt)
library(dplyr)

# Create data frame
hais_data <- data.frame(
  Type = c("Pneumonia (HAP)",
                "Surgical site (SSI)",
                "Bloodstream (BSI)",
                "Urinary tract (UTI)",
                "Clostridioides difficile (CDI)",
                "Total"),
  Cases = c(106586,93222,26976,214150,36002,478222),
  Deaths = c(3968,2328,3905,3664,1917,16245),
  DALYs = c(69508,28842,58350,66701,20890,248920)
)

# Sorting data
hais_desc <- hais_data |>
  filter(Type != "Total") |>
  arrange(desc(Cases)) |>
  bind_rows(hais_data |> filter(Type == "Total"))
```

                           cells_column_spanners()
                         )

                         locations = cells_body(columns = everything(),

    locations = cells_source_notes()) |>
  fmt_number(columns = c(Cases, Deaths, DALYs),
             decimals = 0,
             use_seps = TRUE)
```

As shown in @tbl-hais, healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) remain a major health concern in Germany. In 2011, there were 478,222 cases resulting in 16,245 deaths and 248,920 DALYs. Urinary tract infections were the most common HAI with 214,150 cases, accounting for 45% of all infections. Pneumonia followed with 106,586 cases, while bloodstream infections were rarest with 26,976 cases. But these only show the number of occurrence not the critical severity.

### So what's HAIs severity?

```{r}
#| label: fig-severity
#| fig-cap: "The severity analysis: Pneumonia and Bloodstream dominates Germany infection."
#| echo: false
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library(ggplot2)

severity_data <- data.frame(
  type = c("HAP", "SSI", "BSI", "UTI", "CDI"),
  Cases = c(106586,93222,26976,214150,36002),
  Deaths = c(3968,2328,3905,3664,1917),
  DALYs = c(69508,28842,58350,66701,20890)
)

ggplot(severity_data, aes(x = Cases, y = Deaths, size = DALYs, fill = type)) +
  geom_point(shape = 21, color = "black", stroke = 1, alpha = 1) +
  geom_text(aes(label = type), color = "black", 
            fontface = "bold", size = 4) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c("BSI" = "#DC267F",
      "HAP" = "#FE6100",
      "CDI" = "#FFB000",
      "SSI" = "#009988",
      "UTI" = "#33BBEE"),
      guide = "none")+
  scale_size_continuous(range = c(8,28), guide = "none")+
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::comma, limits = c(0, 250000), expand = c(0.025,0)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma, limits = c(0, 5000)) +
  labs(x = "Annual Number of Cases",
       y = "Annual Attributable Deaths",
       title = "Severity of HAIs",
       caption = "Source: 2011 ECDC Point Prevalence Survey") +
  theme_minimal() + 
  theme(
    panel.grid.major = element_line(color = "gray90", linewidth = 0.5),
    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
    panel.border = element_rect(color = "black", fill = NA, linewidth = 1),
    plot.title = element_text(face = "bold", size=14, hjust = 0.5),
    plot.caption = element_text(hjust = 0, color = "gray40", size = 10),
    axis.title = element_text(face = "bold", size = 12)
  )
```

Frequency doesn't tell the whole story. @fig-severity illustrates this severity patterns through three dimensions: Number of Cases (x-axis), Deaths (y-axis), and DALYs (bubble size). 

Here we see that bloodstream infections (BSI) reaches nearly the same height as Urinary tract infections (UTI) despite being positioned on far left with only 26,976 cases. BSI kills approximate 145 patients per 1,000 cases compared to UTI which is 17 per 1,000 cases, representing 8 times difference in deadliness. However, Pneumonia (HAP) shows the largest bubble reflecting its combination of moderate frequency with 106,586 cases and high mortality of 3,968 deaths that create 69,508 DALYs, represent greatest contributor. 

*Together*, pneumonia and bloodstream infections account for just 28% of cases but cause 51% of total disease burden.

By contrast, the visualisation also reveals the relatively moderate impact of surgical site infections (SSI) and Clostridioides difficile (CDI) with fewer cases and lower mortality.

Therefore, the data suggests that prevention strategies should not just tackle only the most frequent HAIs, but prioritise those that cause the most harm to patients and health system.
